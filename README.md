Hi for launching the game there are a few steps, there seems to be an error on how the jar file uses the data. I tried fixing it, sadly to no avail.
A way to know if it works is if the music loads when starting the music.
If not: open projects in IntelliJ or Vscode (but you'll need to implement the external libraries).

Another known issue is if your computer has a 16:10 ratio, the game won't position the player correctly. I worked on the issue for a week, and I couldn't for the life of me make it observer relative. The game work perfectly on 16:9, I tried it on the screen in the working rooms, and everything works as it should.

On the game, you can start a new game, or load a previous one. Note that if you start a new game, your previous load will be replaced with the current one if you type exit. If you force close the window, your load file won't move.

To start the story, type intro, every piece of information will be said there. You can always type help to show the cheat sheet of the game.
